## Overview
The Todo List App is a simple application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It provides users with a graphical interface to manage their daily tasks. Users can add, delete, mark as done, and filter tasks based on priority or due date. The app supports both light and dark modes, allowing users to customize their experience.

## Features
1. Add Tasks: Users can input tasks using a text field and add them to the list.
2. Task Prioritization: Users can assign priority levels (high, medium, low) to tasks.
3. Due Date: Users can specify due dates for tasks.
4. Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light and dark modes for the interface.
5. Task Management: Users can mark tasks as done or delete them from the list.
6. Task Filtering: Users can filter tasks by priority level or clear existing filters.
7. Task Statistics: Users can view statistics such as the total number of tasks and completed tasks.
8. Save and Load: Tasks are saved locally in a JSON file and loaded when the app starts.

## Usage
1. Adding Tasks: Type the task in the input field and press the "Add" button. Tasks are displayed in the list with their priority and due date (if specified).
2. Setting Priority: When adding a task, users can specify its priority level as high, medium, or low.
3. Setting Due Date: Users can specify a due date for tasks in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
4. Dark Mode: Toggle the "Dark Mode" checkbox to switch between light and dark modes.
5. Task Management: Use the "Done" button to mark tasks as completed and the "Delete" button to remove tasks from the list.
6. Task Filtering: Click the "Filter" button to apply filters based on priority. Users can choose from options such as priority (high to low), priority (low to high), or clear filters.
7. Viewing Task Statistics: Click the "View Stats" button to see statistics such as the total number of tasks and completed tasks.
